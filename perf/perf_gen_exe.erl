%  Info is a map with the following information:
%  #{status             =>    The integer exit value of the application or
%                             undefined if we don't have one. If the program
%                             returned a value greater than 127 it means it
%                             died with a signal.  You can call
%                             gen_exe:status(Status), and it will return either
%                             an integer if the program did not die with a
%                             signal or the tuple {signal, Signal, CoreDumped}
%                             where Signal is an atom indicating the signal
%                             (e.g. sighup) and CoreDumped is a boolean
%                             indicating if a memory dump was requested at the
%                             termination of the program.
%
%    restarts_normal    =>    Count of the number of times the program was
%                             restarted after it exited with a zero status
%                             code. A program is restarted either because of
%                             the keep_alive option to gen_server or because
%                             one of the callbacks returns {restart, ...}
%
%    restarts_abnormal  =>    Same as above, but when the program exited
%                             with a non zero status.
%
%    runparams          =>    A list of {Id,Value tuples}, indicating all the
%                             command-line parameters used in the current
%                             execution of the program.  Each command-line
%                             parameter is identified by an Id which is
%                             specified in the Exespec given to gen_exe}.

% State is the user-defined state that is given to each callback.

% port_start(pre_start,...) can return the following tuples:
% {ok,State}                  * gen_exe keeps the state for the next callback
%                             * port is started with the current runparams
%
% {ok, Runparams ,State}      * gen_exe keeps the state for the next callback
%                             * port is started with a merge of Runparams and
%                               the current runparams. Any value in Runparams
%                               takes precedence over an existing valuein the
%                               current runparams.

% port_start(post_start,...) can return the following tuples:

%                             * port is started with the current runparams
%
% {ok, Runparams ,State}      * gen_exe keeps the state for the next callback
%                             * Runparams is merged with the runparams with
%                               whcih the port was started, and the result
%                               will be used to generate the command-line
%                               for the next execution of the port. Any value
%                               in Runparams takes precedence over an existing
%                               valuein the current runparams.

%                             * port stays closed
%
% {restart, Runparams ,State} * gen_exe keeps the state for the next callback
%                             * Port is restarted, Runparams is merged with the
%                               current runparams and the result will be used
%                               to restart the port. Any value in Runparams
%                               takes precedence over an existing valuein the
